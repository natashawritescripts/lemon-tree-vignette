Lemon Tree Vignette

This is a thriller/game vignette designed as a sample for portfolio purposes.

Lemons...so many lemons...too many lemons. It's a lemon tree, but I fixated on how many lemons there are, and they're eating at me; tearing at me; taunting me. I walk over slowly with patience and upstanding character. I'm peaceful. I'm full of poise. I wouldn't let down a homeless man begging for change...the beggar begging; the way my neighbors begs for her husband to keep going. I slick my hair back on the sides. I look presentable. I must: how I carry myself is how people will view me. I want to be viewed proper and complacent. I am compassionate. I am a good neighbor.  

"Good morning\! Hey...are you alright?"    
"Oh yes...yes I'm doing quite alright, how are you Mrs. Ruthman?"    
"Oh dear."  

I watch her set her garden shears down. The loud garden shears. Her sharp garden shears that cut as deep as I would ever need them to...as deep as she desires them to go.  

"It's a lovely day in the neighborhood\!"  

I pull at a lemon.  

"Is there something wrong here?" another neighbor asks.    
"No nothing at all, you see I just...well it's funny really. These lemons\! There are so many lemons on this darn tree."  

The plop, the crunch, the scream at me.    
"STOP\! LEAVE ME ALONE\!"  

I pull them harder and faster and smile bigger and laugh.    
"I just want to get this tree a little more bare so it can grow more fruit\!"  

I freeze. I stare at the lemon in my hand. I haven't picked it yet. My hand. My arm. I smell salt.    
"Are you sure you're alright?"    
I pull away quickly and let the lemon go. I stare at the lemons on the ground. Red and yellow like a circus clown's outfit, and I let my mouth dry up, partly open.  

A door across the street is open.    
"Our lemons have never bothered you so fiercely before, I reckon you're hurt. Hurt awful."  

I step away with a smile.    
"No...I...I must have gotten a hold of those garden shears of yours."  

I stare at her. I'm mad at her. I'm bombarded with an overwhelming sensation of deep diagnostic...calamity. I smile brightly and walk by quickly, grabbing the garden shears.  

"These sharp things\! I was in the garden, and I came inside and went to my sink, and I must have...well, blood loss by the sink Mrs. Ruthman, you know the sorts, being a nurse, and all. I'll walk back over now. No need for a function over it."  

She looks frightened, and her husband, tall and athletic, rubs the top of his head, staring at the red lemons, and I slick my hair back, pulling in a sharp breath.  

"Clowns\! It's a circus out here, isn't it?"    
I laugh a forced loud laugh. She shakes her head, hand on her chest.    
"Oh dear."  

She runs inside quickly, and her husband stares at me.    
"We're worried about you."    
"You don't have to now\! Now the shears are in my hands so no more dirty lemons\!"  

He looks confused. I roll my shoulders back and breathe sharply.    
"Just some blood loss."    
"And lemons...all these lemons I mean-"    
"Messy\! Wow, really messy. That's why we have to be careful in this neighborhood. Just wash them off. I'll clean up and come wash it all away. No worries, right? We're good?"    
He scratches the back of his head, nods.    
"Perfect\! The less words the better. You're great neighbors."  

I walk by, smile gone. I'm angry again. No. I lied. I feel enthralled as I hold onto the shears tighter. I turn around slowly with a wide grin. Yes. A barren lemon tree.
