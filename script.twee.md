:: Lemon Tree Introduction  
Lemons...so many lemons...too many lemons.    
It's a lemon tree, but I fixated on how many lemons there are, and they're eating at me; tearing at me; taunting me.  

I walk over slowly with patience and upstanding character. I'm peaceful. I'm full of poise. I wouldn't let down a homeless man begging for change...the beggar begging; the way my neighbors begs for her husband to keep going.  

I slick my hair back on the sides. I look presentable. I must: how I carry myself is how people will view me.    
I want to be viewed proper and complacent. I am compassionate. I am a good neighbor.

I step closer and observe the lemons quietly. Their bright yellow and red skins almost glow in the morning sun.    
I take a deep breath, reminding myself to stay composed.

:: Pull Lemons  
I grab at the lemons faster, trying to clear the branches. They plop to the ground, some bruising, some rolling away.    
The crunch of fruit under my hands makes my stomach twist.

"Good morning\! Hey...are you alright?"  

"Oh yes...yes I'm doing quite alright, how are you Mrs. Ruthman."  

"Oh dear."  

I watch her set her garden shears down. Loud, sharp, threatening. They cut as deep as I would ever need them to...as deep as she desires them to go.  

"It's a lovely day in the neighborhood\!"

\[\[Smile and act casual|Ignore Her\]\]

:: Apologize  
"I just wanted to clear the tree a little, Mrs. Ruthman. Sorry if I disturbed anything."  

She looks concerned but nods. "Well, just be careful\!"  

\[\[Step Away|Lemon Tree Finale\]\]

:: Ignore Her  
I pull away with a smile, trying to appear calm.    
The tension in the air lingers, but I don’t address it.

I step away with a smile. I'm angry again. No. I lied. I feel enthralled as I hold onto the shears tighter.  

I turn around slowly with a wide grin...yes. A barren lemon tree.  

The day feels heavy but strangely satisfying. The lemons are gone, but the tension lingers.
